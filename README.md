# Terraform Version X-Ray

Terraform Version X-Ray is a VSCode extension heavily influenced by [Version Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pflannery.vscode-versionlens) that allows you to see the current version information for required providers in-line with your code. Future versions will also support module versions and TerraGrunt.

## Features

Terraform Version X-Ray can be enabled and disabled from the command palette. Clicking a version suggestion updates the version in your code.
